# Building **ScriptHammer**: An Opinionated Expo Framework Tutorial

Welcome! In this step-by-step tutorial, we'll build **ScriptHammer**, an opinionated Expo framework on **Expo SDK 52** using **TypeScript** and **Expo Router**. ScriptHammer is inspired by the modular philosophy of **Bonfire** for CodeIgniter (which provided a ready-made admin area and RBAC scaffolding), and it's designed to jumpstart social networking apps with a built-in Admin Panel, social features, and a CLI-based module generator. We'll cover everything from project structure to theming, backend integration, and automation scripts. Let's dive in! 🔨

## 1. Introduction and Architecture

**ScriptHammer Philosophy:** ScriptHammer aims to **extend Expo** with a strong opinionated structure so you can focus on features instead of boilerplate. It leverages Expo's latest capabilities (SDK 52, which includes **Expo Router v3** for native file-based navigation) and integrates a robust backend via **Supabase**. The core ideas include:

- **Modular Architecture:** Each feature (auth, posts, chat, etc.) is a self-contained module. This modularity makes the codebase scalable and maintainable, similar to Bonfire's HMVC structure but for React Native.
- **File-based Routing with Expo Router:** We use Expo Router's convention-over-configuration approach, where screens are defined by files in the `app/` directory. This means navigation flows are determined by the file tree, simplifying app structure and **eliminating manual route registration**. Route **groups** (folders in parentheses) let us organize routes without affecting URLs, which is great for grouping auth or admin screens logically.
- **Supabase Integration:** Supabase provides our backend-as-a-service with PostgreSQL, authentication, and real-time capabilities. It's an open-source alternative to Firebase, offering instant REST APIs and leveraging **Row Level Security (RLS)** for data privacy. We will use Supabase for **user authentication** (including OAuth logins with Google/Apple) and real-time data (for features like live chat or notifications).
- **Steampunk Aesthetic with NativeWind:** ScriptHammer isn't just functional – it has style! 🎨 We're using **NativeWind** (Tailwind CSS for React Native) to apply a consistent steampunk-themed design across the app. Expect custom fonts, dark parchment-like backgrounds, and gear ⚙️ icons for a retro-futuristic vibe. NativeWind makes it easy to support **dark and light modes** by using Tailwind's theming variants (it auto-detects system theme by default).
- **Integrated Admin Panel:** A key feature is the built-in Admin Panel for managing content and users. This Admin section is accessible only to admins (enforced via RBAC and context checks) and provides tools to moderate the social network.
- **CLI Module Builder:** To speed up development, ScriptHammer includes a CLI tool that can **generate boilerplate code** for new modules (CRUD screens, types, etc.) from a simple configuration (even a XAML file 📄 for the nostalgic!). This is similar to how Bonfire could generate modules for CodeIgniter, giving you a jumpstart on new features.

In summary, the architecture combines **Expo's front-end excellence** with **Supabase's backend power**, wrapped in a stylish theme and structured for productivity. Now let's set up the project structure.

## 2. Project Folder Structure 📂

ScriptHammer follows Expo Router's file-based routing conventions. The entire navigation of the app is driven by the **`app/` directory**:

```
app/
├── (auth)/               # Authentication flows
│   ├── login.tsx         # Login screen
│   ├── register.tsx      # Registration screen
│   └── reset-password.tsx# Password reset screen
├── (main)/               # Main app (protected routes after login)
│   ├── _layout.tsx       # Layout for main app (tabs or stack)
│   ├── index.tsx         # Main feed or dashboard for logged-in users
│   ├── profile/[id].tsx  # Dynamic route for user profiles
│   └── ...               # Other main screens (e.g. chat, settings)
├── admin/                # Admin Panel (restricted to admin users)
│   ├── _layout.tsx       # Admin layout with RBAC check and navigation
│   ├── index.tsx         # Admin dashboard home
│   ├── posts.tsx         # Content management (posts) screen
│   ├── developer.tsx     # Developer tools screen
│   └── settings.tsx      # Settings management screen
└── _layout.tsx           # Global layout (auth provider, theme provider, etc.)
```

Let's break down this structure:

- **Authentication Group (`app/(auth)/`):** This folder contains screens for onboarding users (login, registration, password reset). The **(auth)** parentheses indicate a **route group** that does not add to the navigation path but logically groups auth screens. We will use this to show auth screens only when the user is not logged in. For example, `app/(auth)/login.tsx` defines the login page. Expo Router ensures these routes are available under the hood; we will control access via logic (explained later in the Auth context setup).
- **Main App Group (`app/(main)/`):** Once authenticated, users enter the main app. The (main) group might contain a Tab Navigator or Stack for the core social features. For instance, `app/(main)/index.tsx` could be the feed or home timeline, and `app/(main)/profile/[id].tsx` is a dynamic route for user profiles (the filename `[id].tsx` means it will match a URL like `/profile/123` with the `id` available as a route param). Again, using a group here means the URL path for these screens won't include "main" as a segment, it's just for organization.
- **Admin Panel (`app/admin/`):** The admin section is separated without parentheses, meaning it will have a distinct path (`/admin` on web, or an "Admin" route in native navigation). This section is meant for users with admin roles. We will enforce RBAC by checking the user's role in `admin/_layout.tsx` and redirecting or blocking access for non-admins. The Admin Panel screens are structured by purpose:
  - `admin/index.tsx` – The admin dashboard (overview of the app's metrics or shortcuts).
  - `admin/posts.tsx` – An example "Content" management screen, perhaps listing all posts with abilities to edit or delete (just as an illustration of content management).
  - `admin/developer.tsx` – A "Developer" tools screen (for example, showing environment info or logs, catering to developer/admin roles).
  - `admin/settings.tsx` – A "Settings" screen for application-wide settings or managing user roles.
  
  In the Admin Panel, we'll implement **role-based access control**: only users with the admin role can see these screens. Regular users won't even have navigation links to this section. This keeps the admin UI separate and secure. We'll see in Section 6 how we set up navigation within the Admin Panel (with categories like Content, Developer, Settings).

- **Global Layout (`app/_layout.tsx`):** This file wraps the entire app UI. Here we configure global providers (auth context, theme provider, etc.) and set up navigation structure that applies to all screens. For example, we might use a `<Stack>` navigator here or simply a `<Slot>` to render child screens. Think of `_layout.tsx` as the common shell (it could hold a global header or background if needed).

Beyond the `app/` directory, we maintain a conventional project setup:
- A `src/` folder for non-UI logic, such as `src/lib/` for our Supabase client setup, and `src/context/` for context providers (AuthContext, ThemeContext, etc.).
- Config files like `tailwind.config.js` for theming and `babel.config.js` for Babel configuration.
- An `assets/` directory for fonts, images (e.g., steampunk textures or icons).

With the folders in place, Expo Router automatically knows about our routes. We don't need to manually register screens; just ensure the file names and structure are correct. For instance, adding a new file `app/(main)/chat.tsx` instantly adds a new route for chat. This convention-based routing drastically reduces boilerplate and keeps navigation declaration near the screen code.

Next, let's set up the steampunk theme using NativeWind.

## 3. Theming with NativeWind 🎨

To give our app a unique steampunk look-and-feel, we'll use **NativeWind**, which brings Tailwind CSS utility classes to React Native. This lets us rapidly style components with class names, including responsive styles and dark mode variants. Here's how to set up and customize the theme:

**Installing and Configuring NativeWind:**

1. **Install NativeWind and Tailwind CSS:** If you haven't already, install the packages. For example, using npm: `npm install nativewind tailwindcss`. We also need the Tailwind CLI for initializing the config. (We'll cover this in the automation script too.)
2. **Initialize Tailwind Config:** Run `npx tailwindcss init` to generate a `tailwind.config.js` file. This config is crucial for defining our theme and telling Tailwind which files to scan for class names.
3. **Update `tailwind.config.js`:** We will set up the content paths, dark mode, and our custom theme values (colors, fonts, etc.). Below is a fully configured example:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./app/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}",   // include all files in app directory
    "./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}",   // include files in src (for components, etc.)
  ],
  darkMode: "class",  // use 'class' strategy for manual control (optional)
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        // Steampunk color palette (bronzes, browns, golds, etc.)
        primary: "#6e4b16",   // a bronze-like primary color for backgrounds or headers
        secondary: "#b29762", // a lighter gold for accents
        accent: "#e0dcc2",    // parchment beige for backgrounds
        danger: "#7e1f1f",    // dark red (for delete/destructive actions)
        // ... add more as needed
      },
      fontFamily: {
        // Custom fonts for steampunk vibe (assume we loaded these in assets)
        heading: ["OldLondon", "serif"],   // example custom font for headings
        body: ["Times New Roman", "serif"],// classic serif for body text
      },
      backgroundImage: {
        // Example: a subtle paper texture (would require adding an asset or base64)
        parchment: "url('../assets/images/parchment.png')",
      },
      // You can also extend spacing, animation, etc. for steampunk gears or other motifs
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Let's unpack this config:
- We ensure Tailwind scans all our source files by listing `./app` and `./src` directories in `content`. This way, any className used in those files will be included in the build.
- We set `darkMode: "class"`. By default, NativeWind will follow the system color scheme using `Appearance.getColorScheme()`. Setting `"class"` mode allows us to manually toggle dark/light by adding a class to the root or using the NativeWind `colorScheme` API. This is helpful if we want to provide an in-app theme toggle independent of system settings. If you prefer automatic mode only, you could omit this or use `"media"`.
- In `theme.extend`, we define custom colors that fit a steampunk theme: **primary** could be a dark bronze, **secondary** a brass/gold, **accent** a paper-like beige, etc. We also add a **danger** color for destructive actions (like a dark red rust).
- We specify `fontFamily` for headings and body. For a real steampunk feel, you might use ornate or typewriter-style fonts. In this example, "OldLondon" could be a decorative Victorian-style font (make sure to add the font files to your project and load them via Expo's Font module). We fall back to generic serif fonts if the custom ones aren't available.
- A custom `backgroundImage` named *parchment* is set up as an example, referencing an image in assets. React Native doesn't support CSS background images out-of-the-box, but you can use Image components. This config could be more useful if using NativeWind on web, but it's shown here for completeness of theme idea.
- No extra plugins for Tailwind are used in this config, but you could include plugins for forms or custom utilities if needed.

**Enabling NativeWind in Expo:**
- Add the NativeWind Babel plugin. In your `babel.config.js`, include `"nativewind/babel"`. Also, since we're using Expo Router, we include the Expo Router plugin. A complete `babel.config.js` might look like:

```js
module.exports = function(api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: [
      ["babel-preset-expo", { jsxImportSource: "nativewind" }],  // enable nativewind JSX transform
    ],
    plugins: [
      "nativewind/babel",      // NativeWind plugin to handle className
      "expo-router/babel",     // Expo Router plugin for file-based routing
      // ...you can add others like Reanimated if needed
    ],
  };
};
```

The above ensures that our JSX is processed correctly to apply Tailwind styles via NativeWind. The `jsxImportSource: "nativewind"` is a trick to allow using className in JSX without explicit imports (it tells Babel to use nativewind's JSX factory).

- If you plan to support web, you'll also need a `global.css` import to inject Tailwind's base styles. For a native app, this isn't necessary; styles are applied via the React Native StyleSheet. But for completeness: if you created a `global.css` (with `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`), you'd import it in your root layout (as shown in NativeWind docs).

**Using the Theme in Components:**
With everything configured, using the theme is a breeze. You can add Tailwind classes to your React Native components via the `className` prop:
```tsx
// Example component snippet
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

<View className="flex-1 bg-accent dark:bg-black p-4">
  <Text className="text-primary dark:text-secondary font-heading text-2xl">
    Welcome to ScriptHammer ⚙️
  </Text>
  <Text className="text-base font-body text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-200">
    Build your app with a steampunk twist!
  </Text>
</View>
```
In this snippet:
- We use `bg-accent` for the background, which applies our parchment beige in light mode. In dark mode, `dark:bg-black` would override it to black (or you could use another dark color).
- The heading Text uses `text-primary` (bronze) in light mode, and `dark:text-secondary` (gold) in dark mode. It also applies `font-heading` and a size utility.
- The body Text uses a default gray (`text-zinc-800` from Tailwind palette) and switches to a lighter gray in dark mode.

NativeWind will automatically apply these styles. Dark mode can be toggled by the system or manually by using the `useColorScheme` hook from NativeWind and calling `setColorScheme("dark" | "light")` as needed.

At this point, our app has a distinct style foundation. Now, let's connect our app to the Supabase backend for authentication and data.

## 4. Supabase Backend Integration 🔒

To power the social features (profiles, posts, chats) and handle authentication, we'll integrate **Supabase** into our Expo app. Supabase gives us a Postgres database with a REST API, authentication (with support for email/password, magic links, and OAuth providers), storage, and real-time subscriptions. It's perfect for a mobile app backend because it eliminates the need for a custom server. Let's set it up:

**Supabase Installation and Setup:**
- **Install Supabase JS client:** We use the official Supabase JS library. In an Expo app (SDK 52), it works well with a few tweaks for React Native (like providing a storage for the auth session). Install with npm: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js @react-native-async-storage/async-storage`. The `async-storage` is a community package that we'll use to store the Supabase auth token securely on device.
- **Obtain Supabase Credentials:** You should have a Supabase project created. Get your **Supabase URL** and **Anon (public) Key** from the project settings. In a real app, keep these in a secure place or use environment variables. For our tutorial, we'll just inject them in a config file or `.env` (make sure not to expose the service_role key in the client!).

**Initializing the Supabase Client:**
We'll create a helper in `src/lib/supabase.ts` to initialize and export the Supabase client:

```ts
// src/lib/supabase.ts
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

// Your Supabase project URL and anon key
const supabaseUrl = "<YOUR-SUPABASE-URL>";
const supabaseAnonKey = "<YOUR-ANON-KEY>";

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
  auth: {
    storage: AsyncStorage,            // Persist session in AsyncStorage
    autoRefreshToken: true,           // Refresh JWT token automatically
    persistSession: true,             // Save session for next app launch
    detectSessionInUrl: false,        // Not needed for mobile apps (no URL callback)
  },
});
```

This is the recommended setup for React Native/Expo. By configuring the Supabase client with AsyncStorage, the user's auth session (JWT token) will be stored on device, so they remain logged in across app restarts. We disabled `detectSessionInUrl` because in a mobile context we won't have OAuth redirect come back via a URL in the browser (we'll handle OAuth differently).

Now we can import this `supabase` client in any file to call Supabase APIs, for example:
```ts
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase';

// Sign Up example
const { error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password });
if (error) alert(error.message);

// Sign In with email
await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password });

// Or Sign In with OAuth (Google as an example)
await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' });
```
Supabase supports providers like Google, Apple, Facebook, etc. When using `signInWithOAuth` in Expo, it will open a web browser for the OAuth flow. To handle the redirect after social login, configure a **deep link** in your Expo app and in Supabase (Supabase Auth settings allow adding a custom OAuth redirect, which for Expo might be something like `exp://<your-expo-project-id>.expo.dev`). Expo's AuthSession or Linking can intercept the callback. (Deep linking setup is a bit beyond this scope, but Supabase docs have a guide for it.)

**Real-time Data with Supabase:**
One of Supabase's coolest features is real-time database updates via WebSockets (powered by PostgreSQL's replication). In a social app, we can use this for features like live chat or notifications. For example, to listen for new messages on a `messages` table:
```ts
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

useEffect(() => {
  const channel = supabase
    .channel('public:messages')  // channel name can be anything unique
    .on(
      'postgres_changes', 
      { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'messages' },
      (payload) => {
        console.log('New message received!', payload.new);
        // You could update local state or send a notification in-app
      }
    )
    .subscribe();

  return () => {
    supabase.removeChannel(channel);
  };
}, []);
```
This uses the Supabase v2 subscription syntax (`supabase.channel().on('postgres_changes', ...)`). Now our app will react to any new row inserted into `messages`. You can set up similar listeners for updates or deletes, and for other tables like posts or friend requests to get live updates (e.g., instant friend request notifications).

**Row-Level Security (RLS) and RBAC:**
Security is crucial in a multi-user app. Supabase enables **RLS** by default, meaning you must define who can read or write each table's rows. In ScriptHammer, we'll leverage RLS policies to enforce RBAC:
- For general tables (like posts, comments), only allow the row owner (e.g., a `user_id` column matches `auth.uid()`) to edit/delete, and allow authenticated users to read public data.
- For admin actions, you have a few options. One approach is to use a custom claim or a separate table to mark admins. For instance, an `is_admin` flag in a `profiles` table for each user. Then in your RLS policy, you could allow full access if `exists(select 1 from profiles p where p.id = auth.uid() and p.is_admin)` (this is a possible SQL policy condition).
- Alternatively, Supabase now allows **Custom JWT Claims & Roles**. You can assign a user the role "admin" in Supabase and include that in the JWT. Your RLS policy could then check `auth.role() = 'admin'` to permit access. For simplicity, we won't dive deep into JWT custom claims here, but know it's an option for advanced RBAC.
- For our admin panel, we might *not* rely solely on the client Supabase anon key for dangerous operations. A cautious approach is to implement admin functions via Supabase Edge Functions or an API route with admin service key, so normal clients can't simply bypass by fiddling with the app. However, contextually in-app we will hide and guard those routes too.

In summary, Supabase will handle:
- **Auth:** user accounts, email verification, password resets (Supabase can send emails for these), and OAuth.
- **Database & Storage:** storing user profile info, posts, images if any (Supabase Storage handles files with permission controls).
- **Real-time:** sending updates for live features.
- **Security:** RLS to ensure users only access their own data unless allowed.

Next, let's see how ScriptHammer helps us rapidly scaffold new modules (like Posts, Comments, etc.) with a CLI tool.

## 5. Modular CRUD Scaffolding with CLI Builder ⚙️

To boost productivity, ScriptHammer includes a Command-Line Interface tool that can generate boilerplate code for new modules. Think of it as your personal code blacksmith forging new parts of your app on demand 🛠️. This CLI is inspired by the module generator in Bonfire (where you could create new modules with a form or command). Our CLI will create the typical files needed for a feature, such as screens and maybe a basic data-access layer.

**What the CLI Does:**
- Takes a module name (e.g., "Post", "Comment", "FriendRequest") and optional configuration file.
- Creates a folder under `app/(main)/` (or another appropriate place) with screens for list/detail or needed pages.
- Generates TypeScript files with starter code: perhaps a context or hook for data, and screen components with basic layout.
- Optionally reads a **XAML configuration file** for default settings. The use of XAML (an XML format often used in UI definitions) is a playful twist – you could define your data model and UI preferences in a `.xaml` file, and the CLI will parse it to customize the generated code.

**Example XAML Config (conceptual):**
Imagine a file `post.xaml`:
```xml
<Module name="Post">
  <Model table="posts" primaryKey="id">
    <Field name="title" type="string" />
    <Field name="content" type="text" />
    <Field name="author_id" type="uuid" ref="profiles.id" />
    <Field name="created_at" type="timestamp" />
  </Model>
  <Screens>
    <List title="All Posts" />
    <Detail titleField="title" />
    <Form excludeFields="author_id,created_at" />
  </Screens>
</Module>
```
This is a hypothetical config describing a Post module. It lists fields (perhaps mapping to a Supabase table) and indicates we want a List screen, a Detail screen (using the post title in the header, for example), and a Form screen for creating/editing posts (excluding some auto fields). The CLI would interpret this and generate corresponding files.

**Using the CLI:**
You might run a command like:  
```bash
npx scripthammer generate module Post --config post.xaml
``` 
Or even interactively: `npx scripthammer new-module` and it prompts for the details.

**CLI Implementation Outline:**
Let's sketch what the CLI script might look like (in Node.js for example). We won't write a full parser, but show the structure:

```ts
#!/usr/bin/env node
// scripthammer-cli.ts

import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';
// You might use an XML parser library for Node, e.g. xml2js
import { parseStringPromise } from 'xml2js';

interface FieldDef { name: string; type: string; }
interface ModuleConfig {
  name: string;
  fields: FieldDef[];
  screens: { list?: boolean; detail?: boolean; form?: boolean };
}

// Read command-line args
const args = process.argv.slice(2);
const moduleName = args[0];
const configPath = args.find(arg => arg.endsWith('.xaml'));

if (!moduleName) {
  console.error("Usage: scripthammer generate module <Name> [--config file.xaml]");
  process.exit(1);
}

// Default config if no file provided
let moduleConfig: ModuleConfig = { 
  name: moduleName, 
  fields: [], 
  screens: { list: true, detail: true, form: true } 
};

if (configPath) {
  const xmlData = fs.readFileSync(configPath, 'utf-8');
  const parsed = await parseStringPromise(xmlData);
  // Extract info from parsed XML (this is simplified pseudo-code)
  moduleConfig.name = parsed.Module.$.name || moduleName;
  moduleConfig.fields = parsed.Module.Model[0].Field.map((f: any) => ({
    name: f.$.name,
    type: f.$.type
  }));
  // Determine which screens to generate
  const screensNode = parsed.Module.Screens?.[0] || {};
  moduleConfig.screens.list = !!screensNode.List;
  moduleConfig.screens.detail = !!screensNode.Detail;
  moduleConfig.screens.form = !!screensNode.Form;
}

// Create folder for the module under app/(main)/
const moduleDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'app', '(main)', moduleConfig.name.toLowerCase());
if (!fs.existsSync(moduleDir)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(moduleDir, { recursive: true });
}

// Helper to capitalize module name for component class names
const CapName = moduleConfig.name.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + moduleConfig.name.slice(1);

// Template for List screen
if (moduleConfig.screens.list) {
  const listScreen = 
`import { View, Text, ScrollView } from 'react-native';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { supabase } from '../../src/lib/supabase';

export default function ${CapName}List() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState<${CapName}[]>([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch all ${moduleConfig.name}s from Supabase
    supabase.from('${moduleConfig.name.toLowerCase()}s').select('*')
      .then(({ data, error }) => {
        if (!error && data) setItems(data);
      });
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <ScrollView className="flex-1 p-4">
      {items.map(item => (
        <View key={item.id} className="mb-2 p-2 border-b border-gray-300">
          <Text className="text-lg font-bold">${'${item.title || "Unnamed"}'}</Text>
          <Text>{'${item.content?.substring(0,100) || ""}'}...</Text>
        </View>
      ))}
    </ScrollView>
  );
}

// Define the ${CapName} type (you might generate this from fields or Supabase schema)
interface ${CapName} {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  // ...other fields...
}
`;
  fs.writeFileSync(path.join(moduleDir, 'index.tsx'), listScreen);
}

// Template for Detail screen
if (moduleConfig.screens.detail) {
  const detailScreen =
`import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { useLocalSearchParams } from 'expo-router';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { supabase } from '../../src/lib/supabase';

export default function ${CapName}Detail() {
  const { id } = useLocalSearchParams();
  const [item, setItem] = useState<${CapName} | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (id) {
      supabase.from('${moduleConfig.name.toLowerCase()}s').select('*').eq('id', id).single()
        .then(({ data }) => setItem(data));
    }
  }, [id]);

  if (!item) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;

  return (
    <View className="flex-1 p-4">
      <Text className="text-2xl font-heading">{item.title}</Text>
      <Text className="mt-2">{item.content}</Text>
      {/* More fields here */}
    </View>
  );
}
`;
  fs.writeFileSync(path.join(moduleDir, '[id].tsx'), detailScreen);
}

// Template for Form screen (New/Edit)
if (moduleConfig.screens.form) {
  const formScreen =
`import { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button } from 'react-native';
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';
import { supabase } from '../../src/lib/supabase';

export default function ${CapName}Form() {
  const router = useRouter();
  // form state for each field
  const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
  const [content, setContent] = useState('');
  
  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    const { error } = await supabase.from('${moduleConfig.name.toLowerCase()}s')
      .insert({ title, content });
    if (!error) {
      router.back(); // go back after creating
    } else {
      alert(error.message);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View className="flex-1 p-4">
      <Text className="text-xl font-heading mb-4">Create ${CapName}</Text>
      <TextInput placeholder="Title" value={title} onChangeText={setTitle}
                 className="border mb-2 p-2" />
      <TextInput placeholder="Content" value={content} onChangeText={setContent}
                 className="border mb-2 p-2" multiline />
      <Button title="Submit" onPress={handleSubmit} />
    </View>
  );
}
`;
  fs.writeFileSync(path.join(moduleDir, 'new.tsx'), formScreen);
}

console.log(`Module ${CapName} generated at app/(main)/${moduleConfig.name.toLowerCase()}/`);
```

Don't worry if that's a lot to take in! The key idea is that the CLI uses templates to produce files. In the example above, for each screen type (List, Detail, Form), we created a template string containing some basic React Native code with Tailwind classes and Supabase calls:
- The *List* screen fetches all items from Supabase and lists them.
- The *Detail* screen fetches one item by ID (using Expo Router's `useLocalSearchParams` to get the `id` from the dynamic route).
- The *Form* screen has a simple uncontrolled form to insert a new item (or it could be adapted to edit if we pass an existing item).

The CLI ensures consistent naming and file placement. After running it for "Post", you would have:
```
app/(main)/post/
  index.tsx        // list view
  [id].tsx         // detail view
  new.tsx          // form view
```
You might integrate these into navigation (for example, the main feed could link to `post/new` or `post/[id]` pages).

Of course, in a real scenario, you'd flesh out the templates further (error handling, loading states, etc.), and possibly generate test files or update navigation config. But this demonstrates the power of automation. With a CLI like this, adding new features becomes much faster – you get a working CRUD interface in seconds, then you can tweak the details as needed.

Now, let's focus on how the Admin Panel is implemented and how we handle navigation based on user roles.

## 6. Admin Panel and Context-Based Navigation 🗂️

The Admin Panel in ScriptHammer provides a centralized place for administrators to manage the app's content and settings. It features a **role-based dashboard**: regular users won't see it, while admin users can access various management screens. We will use **React Context** (Auth context) to determine the user's role and conditionally render navigation.

**Admin Panel Structure:**
As outlined in the folder structure, admin screens reside in `app/admin/`. We have sections grouped conceptually into **Content**, **Developer**, and **Settings** (these correspond to `posts.tsx`, `developer.tsx`, and `settings.tsx` in our example, but you can imagine more screens or subdivide further).

We want to create a navigation UI for the admin that makes it easy to switch between these sections. On mobile, a common approach is to use a Tab Navigator for top-level sections. Expo Router allows us to set up a Tabs layout in the admin folder.

**Admin Layout with Tabs:**
In `app/admin/_layout.tsx`, we will define a Tabs navigator and also include a guard for admin access. Here's a complete example:

```tsx
// app/admin/_layout.tsx
import { Tabs, Redirect } from 'expo-router';
import { useAuth } from '../../src/context/AuthContext'; // our Auth context

export default function AdminLayout() {
  const { user } = useAuth();  // assume user object has roles or an isAdmin flag

  // If the user is not an admin, redirect them out of the admin panel
  if (!user || !user.isAdmin) {
    return <Redirect href="/" />;  // send non-admins to home (main index)
  }

  return (
    <Tabs screenOptions={{ headerStyle: { backgroundColor: '#6e4b16' }, headerTintColor: '#fff' }}>
      <Tabs.Screen name="index" options={{ title: 'Dashboard' }} />
      <Tabs.Screen name="posts" options={{ title: 'Content' }} />
      <Tabs.Screen name="developer" options={{ title: 'Developer' }} />
      <Tabs.Screen name="settings" options={{ title: 'Settings' }} />
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```

Let's break that down:
- We use our `useAuth` hook (from a context provider we'll set up) to get the current `user`. We assume `user.isAdmin` is a boolean (this would be set based on Supabase user data, e.g., from the profiles table or a JWT claim as discussed).
- If the user is not an admin, we immediately `<Redirect>` them. Expo Router's `<Redirect>` component will navigate them away. In this case, we send them to the root (`"/"` which is our main app index). This is a safety net in case someone somehow navigates to an admin route they're not allowed to see.
- If the user is admin, we render a `<Tabs>` navigator. Each `<Tabs.Screen>` corresponds to one of our admin screens:
  - `index` tab: labeled "Dashboard". This would show `admin/index.tsx`, possibly an overview of app metrics or a welcome message.
  - `posts` tab: labeled "Content". This could list all posts or content items, allowing deletion or moderation (i.e., content management).
  - `developer` tab: labeled "Developer". This might show developer-oriented info, such as logs, feature toggles, or a place to run the module generator in-app (if you integrate it).
  - `settings` tab: labeled "Settings". Here an admin could manage user roles, app settings, etc.
- We applied a custom `headerStyle` to the tabs (e.g., a bronze background and white text) to match our theme. Each tab screen will inherit this header style.

When an admin user navigates to the Admin Panel, they'll see a bottom tab bar (or top tabs) with these four sections. They can switch between them easily. Meanwhile, a non-admin user would never see this UI; you might hide any link to "Admin Panel" in the main app's menu for them entirely.

**Role-based Content in Screens:**
Within each admin screen (like `posts.tsx`), you might still double-check the user role or fetch data accordingly. But since our layout already gates access, you can be fairly confident the user is allowed. However, defense in depth: it could be wise to also enforce permission in the backend (e.g., the Supabase policy might only allow an admin to delete posts, so even if a malicious user tries, the request fails).

**Context-Based Navigation:**
The phrase "context-based navigation" refers to using React Context (or any app state) to decide what navigation options to show. In ScriptHammer, the AuthContext provides user info (including role). We use that in:
- AdminLayout as shown (to choose between admin tabs or redirect).
- Potentially in the main app layout or screens: e.g., a Drawer or Menu that lists "Admin Panel" only if `user.isAdmin`. For instance, if you have a profile screen for a user, if they are admin you could show an "⚙️ Admin Panel" button that navigates to `/admin`.
- Navigation behaviors: after login, if a user is admin, you might even route them to admin dashboard first or show a prompt. It depends on your app's flow.

In our implementation, context usage is straightforward. We'll implement the AuthProvider such that it fetches the supabase user session (including maybe an `isAdmin` field from the user's profile) and then provide that to `useAuth()` hook. This way, anywhere in the app we know the role.

By structuring the Admin Panel separately, we've achieved a clean separation of concerns:
- Regular users and admins largely use different screens, even if they share underlying data. This prevents accidentally exposing admin UI to normals.
- We can develop the admin features somewhat independently (e.g., an admin might have a different navigation pattern like tabs, while the main app might use a feed and drawer).
- The RBAC logic is mostly centralized in one place (the context + the admin layout).

Now that we have the admin interface conceptually ready, let's finalize our main entry point of the app and tie all providers together.

## 7. Main Entry Point and Provider Setup 🏗️

The main entry for an Expo Router app is typically `app/_layout.tsx` at the root. This is where we configure things that should persist across the whole app (navigation structure, theming, auth context, etc.). We will set up our context providers here and integrate Expo Router's Slot (or a Stack navigator).

**Auth Provider:**
We'll have an `AuthProvider` that uses Supabase to track authentication state. It might subscribe to `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange` to get login/logout events and keep `user` in state. It also might fetch the user's profile (including roles) from Supabase after login. For simplicity, assume we have a context like:
```ts
// src/context/AuthContext.tsx (simplified)
import { createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase';

const AuthContext = createContext({ user: null, session: null });
export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);

export function AuthProvider({ children }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [session, setSession] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check initial session and user
    supabase.auth.getSession().then(({ data }) => {
      setSession(data.session);
      setUser(data.session?.user ?? null);
    });
    // Listen for changes (login, logout)
    const { data: listener } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
      setSession(session);
      setUser(session?.user ?? null);
    });
    return () => listener.subscription.unsubscribe();
  }, []);

  return <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, session }}>{children}</AuthContext.Provider>;
}
```
This would provide `user` (which could include user.app_metadata or we might augment it with an `isAdmin` by fetching a profile row). In a real app, you'd probably fetch additional user info from a `profiles` table and merge it in context.

**Theme Provider:**
For theme, since we use NativeWind, we might not need a complex provider; NativeWind's `useColorScheme` can manage theme switching. However, if we want a manual toggle, we could create a `ThemeContext` that stores a theme value and provides a function to toggle it, which under the hood calls `colorScheme.set(...)` from NativeWind. Alternatively, we rely on the OS setting and allow the user to override via a button that just calls `setColorScheme`.

**Global State Provider:**
If needed, you might have another context for global app state (like global settings or a state management library integration). For our purposes, we can assume any additional context would be wrapped similarly. If not needed, you can skip a separate global provider.

**Assembling in Root Layout:**
Now let's write `app/_layout.tsx` to include these providers and Expo Router's navigation:

```tsx
// app/_layout.tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';
import { AuthProvider } from '../src/context/AuthContext';
import { NativeWindStyleSheet } from 'nativewind';  // optional: configure NativeWind
import { useColorScheme } from 'nativewind';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

// Ensure NativeWind uses native styles (improves performance)
NativeWindStyleSheet.setOutput({ default: "native" });

export default function RootLayout() {
  // Optional: ensure the app uses system theme on start
  const { colorScheme } = useColorScheme();
  useEffect(() => {
    // This effect runs to log current scheme (light/dark)
    console.log("Current color scheme:", colorScheme);
  }, [colorScheme]);

  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      {/* You could wrap ThemeProvider here if created one */}
      <Stack 
        screenOptions={{
          headerShown: false,   // we can handle headers in layouts if needed
        }} 
      />
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}
```

Here's what we're doing:
- Wrapping the navigation in `<AuthProvider>`, so that any child screen can access auth state via `useAuth()`. This means even our `AdminLayout` and others have access to `user`.
- We aren't explicitly using a `<ThemeProvider>` because NativeWind covers that. However, you could implement one to allow toggling between light and dark. In that case, you'd wrap it similarly and perhaps utilize `useColorScheme`.
- We use `<Stack>` from Expo Router to define a navigation container. By placing `<Stack>` here without a `<Slot />`, we're telling Expo Router to use a Stack Navigator for all child screens by default. We turned off the header because each screen or layout can define its own header if needed (for example, our AdminLayout provides its own header styling).
- We also included a snippet to set NativeWind's output mode to "native" (which is a performance optimization for RN StyleSheet usage).
- The `useColorScheme` hook here is just logged as an example. By default, because our `app.json` likely has `"userInterfaceStyle": "automatic"`, the app will use system light/dark mode.

With this in place, our app on launch will initialize Auth (check if user is logged in or not) and then render the navigation structure:
- If not logged in, there's no special redirect at root; by default, it will show the first route it finds. If we want, we could make the root route redirect to `(auth)/login` when no user. Alternatively, we could place the login screen outside any group and handle redirect logic in a layout (like Expo's example where they had `/sign-in` outside and `(app)` group protected). Either approach works. For clarity, you might implement something similar: e.g., in `app/(main)/_layout.tsx`, if `!user` then `<Redirect href="/(auth)/login" />`. Or just have the AuthContext manage it.
- If logged in, the `(auth)` screens won't be used and the user sees the main app (`(main)` routes or wherever you send them first).
- If the user is admin and they navigate to admin routes, the AuthContext ensures `user.isAdmin` is true so AdminLayout allows it.

Finally, let's discuss automating all this setup with a script, so you can create a new ScriptHammer-based project quickly.

## 8. Automation Script for Project Setup 🏁

To make it easy to start a new project with this stack, here's a **Bash script** that automates the initial setup. This script will:
- Create a new Expo app (with TypeScript).
- Install all needed packages (Expo Router, NativeWind/Tailwind, Supabase, etc.).
- Scaffold the folder structure (making the `app/(auth)`, `app/(main)`, `app/admin` directories, and `src` subdirectories).
- Create the configuration files like `tailwind.config.js` and `babel.config.js` with the required settings.

Let's go through the script step-by-step. 📝 *(Each step is commented for clarity.)*

echo "🎉 ScriptHammer project setup complete! Happy coding! 🔨"
```

A few notes on the script:
- We used `npx create-expo-app@latest` with the TypeScript template to start the project. This gives us a working Expo project with TS out of the box.
- We then install dependencies. Notice we did `expo install expo-router` to ensure compatibility with the Expo SDK version (this also installs some peer dependencies like `react-native-safe-area-context` and others as needed). We used `npm` for other packages; you could also use `expo install` for those that have native code, but `nativewind` and `supabase-js` are pure JS so it's fine.
- The folder creation uses `mkdir -p`. We had to escape parentheses with backslashes because in bash parentheses have special meaning.
- We output a ready `tailwind.config.js` and `babel.config.js` using `cat > ... << 'EOF' ... EOF`. These include the configurations we discussed in Section 3 (colors, fonts, etc.) and Babel with the required plugins.
- We run `npx tailwindcss init -p` mainly to generate a `postcss.config.js`. The `-p` adds the PostCSS config. This is more relevant if we run the app on web; it doesn't harm to have it.
- We create some basic files (`_layout.tsx`, a login screen, and a main index screen) with minimal content to ensure the app runs. The login screen uses Supabase `signInWithPassword` and on success navigates to the main app (`router.replace("/")`). The main screen greets the user and if the user is admin, shows a button to go to the Admin Panel. (This is a simple way to surface admin navigation; in a real app you might have a menu or a different UX pattern.)
- We echo messages with emojis at key steps to make it clear in the terminal output what is happening (but we use them sparingly so as not to clutter).

After running this script, you could `cd MyScriptHammerApp` and run `npx expo start` to launch the app 🎉. You should see the login screen (since no user is logged in yet). Once you integrate it with your Supabase project (update the Supabase URL and anon key in `src/lib/supabase.ts` which we created via the script), you can actually use the login to authenticate. After login, it should redirect to the main screen. If the logged-in user has an admin role (you would set `user.isAdmin` in AuthContext after fetching profile), the "Go to Admin Panel" button would appear.

---

**Conclusion:** We have now built **ScriptHammer**, a comprehensive Expo-based framework scaffold. We covered everything from setting up the project structure with Expo Router's conventions to customizing the theme with NativeWind, integrating Supabase for a full-stack solution, generating modules with a CLI, and managing an admin interface with RBAC. The provided code snippets are production-ready starting points – of course, you'll want to expand and refine them for a real application (handle edge cases, improve styling, etc.), but the foundation is solid.

We hope this tutorial empowers you to rapidly build your next social app **⚡**. ScriptHammer gives you the tools and structure; now it's time to create something amazing. Happy coding! 😊🔨
