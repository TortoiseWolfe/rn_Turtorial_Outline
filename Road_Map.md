## 1. Executive Overview

Our goal is to create an opinionated framework—think of it as “Bonfire for Expo”—that simplifies building mobile apps for small businesses. By leveraging Expo, Supabase for the backend, NativeWind for styling, Storybook for component development, and a built-in testing framework, we ensure the framework remains modern, accessible, and easy to integrate into existing systems. Key functionalities include:

- **Admin Dashboard with Role-Based Access:** First registered user becomes admin; subsequent users default to “user.”
- **Social Network Core:** Posts, chats, and other basic social interactions.
- **Dynamic Branding & Scaffolding:** Use the project name as a project variable and provide an interface for generating CRUD operations, adaptable to different business domains.
- **Robust Developer Experience:** Out-of-the-box Storybook integration, comprehensive testing, and consistent styling with NativeWind.

## 2. Phase 1 – MVP Features & Prioritization

For the MVP, we need to focus on the core functionality that delivers immediate value to our target users. Here’s what to prioritize:

### A. **Core Infrastructure**
- **Project Setup & Repository Structure:**
  - Initialize an Expo managed workflow.
  - Establish a clear folder structure separating components, screens, services, and configurations.
  - Configure environment variables and project-level settings (e.g., project name).
- **Coding Standards & Linting:**
  - Set up ESLint, Prettier, and commit hooks to enforce code quality.
  - Define style guides and coding conventions to maintain consistency across the codebase.

### B. **Backend Integration with Supabase**
- **Authentication & User Management:**
  - Implement user sign-up/sign-in flows.
  - Define roles so that the first sign-up defaults to “admin” and all others to “user.”
- **Database Schema:**
  - Design tables for users, posts, chats, and any initial social network interactions.
  - Set up necessary relationships and indices to ensure performance.
- **API Service Layer:**
  - Develop a robust service layer to handle interactions with Supabase.
  - Include error handling and logging mechanisms.

### C. **Admin Dashboard & Role-Based Access Control**
- **Dashboard UI:**
  - Build an admin dashboard accessible only to users with the “admin” role.
  - Use React Navigation (or another routing library) for navigation between admin screens.
- **Role-Based Components:**
  - Develop higher-order components or hooks to enforce role-based access within the UI.
  - Secure endpoints on both the client and server sides to ensure data integrity.

### D. **Core Social Network Functionality**
- **Posts & Chat Modules:**
  - Create screens for posting content and chatting.
  - Integrate real-time capabilities via Supabase subscriptions.
- **User Interface & Styling:**
  - Implement the global styling system using NativeWind.
  - Provide a default system theme with toggling options for dark/light mode.
  - Ensure the project name is dynamically injected in the header (branding).

### E. **Developer Experience Enhancements**
- **Storybook Integration:**
  - Set up Storybook to document and test UI components in isolation.
  - Create initial stories for key components like headers, buttons, and form elements.
- **Testing Framework:**
  - Integrate a testing solution (e.g., Jest with React Native Testing Library).
  - Write initial unit and integration tests for core modules to ensure reliability.

### F. **Scaffolding Interface for CRUD Operations**
- **Dynamic Scaffolding:**
  - Develop an interface to allow small business owners to define and generate CRUD operations dynamically.
  - Provide templates that can be customized based on the type of business (e.g., widgets, real estate).
- **Integration & Extensibility:**
  - Ensure the scaffolding tool is easily extendable to add additional fields and custom business logic.

## 3. Detailed Implementation Steps for MVP

### **Step 1: Initial Setup & Configuration**
- **Repository and Project Setup:**
  - Initialize the Expo project and configure the project structure.
  - Integrate ESLint, Prettier, and commit hooks.
- **Environment & Branding:**
  - Create configuration files that store global project variables (e.g., project name).
  - Ensure these variables are accessible in the header component for dynamic branding.

### **Step 2: Supabase Integration & Backend Setup**
- **Authentication Module:**
  - Integrate Supabase Auth.
  - Write logic to assign the “admin” role to the first user.
- **Database Schema and API:**
  - Set up initial tables in Supabase for users, posts, chats, etc.
  - Build a service layer for API calls with proper error handling and logging.

### **Step 3: Building the Admin Dashboard**
- **UI Components & Navigation:**
  - Develop the main dashboard layout.
  - Create protected routes/components that enforce role-based access.
- **Role Enforcement:**
  - Use hooks or context to manage user roles and permissions throughout the app.

### **Step 4: Implementing Social Network Features**
- **Posts & Chats:**
  - Create components for displaying, creating, and interacting with posts.
  - Set up chat interfaces with real-time updates.
- **Styling and Theming:**
  - Integrate NativeWind to apply global styles.
  - Implement dark/light theme toggling based on system settings.

### **Step 5: Developer Experience Tools**
- **Storybook Setup:**
  - Configure Storybook and add initial stories for reusable UI components.
- **Testing Setup:**
  - Integrate Jest (or another testing framework) and write tests for critical paths.

### **Step 6: CRUD Scaffolding Interface**
- **Interface Design:**
  - Design a user-friendly interface that guides users through creating custom CRUD operations.
- **Dynamic Code Generation:**
  - Implement logic that dynamically generates form components and API endpoints based on user input.

## 4. Future Roadmap for Version 2

While the MVP focuses on core functionalities, keep the following features on your radar for future versions:

- **Enhanced Widget Customization:**
  - Allow for more complex, customizable widgets beyond the basic CRUD operations.
- **Advanced Analytics & Reporting:**
  - Integrate analytics dashboards for monitoring app usage and user interactions.
- **Scalability Enhancements:**
  - Optimize database interactions and API endpoints for performance as user numbers grow.
- **Additional Integrations:**
  - Consider integrating additional third-party services for payments, scheduling, or marketing.
- **Improved UX & Accessibility:**
  - Refine the user interface based on user feedback to improve usability and accessibility.
- **Extensive Role Management:**
  - Expand the role-based system to include more granular permissions and multi-tier access control.

## 5. Best Practices & Integration Reminders

- **Maintain Codebase Integrity:**
  - Always integrate new modules with the existing system, ensuring consistency with the current architecture and coding standards.
- **Automated Testing & CI/CD:**
  - Leverage automated tests and continuous integration pipelines to catch regressions early.
- **Documentation:**
  - Document every new module and update the developer guide to maintain clarity across the team.
- **Iterative Development:**
  - Build the MVP in iterations, and prioritize core features that deliver value immediately while planning for future enhancements.
- **User-Centered Design:**
  - Keep the end-user in mind, especially small business owners, and ensure the interface is intuitive with minimal setup overhead.
