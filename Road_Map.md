Below is your **updated** roadmap from **Phase 7 onward**, **emphasizing** that each time you prime ChatGPT for a new phase, you want a **fully functional tutorial**—complete code (no placeholders) and, at the end of each phase’s solution, a **Node scaffolding script** to automate the new files. 

You’ve already finished phases **1–6** (real Supabase auth, RLS, DB triggers, minimal token storage, real-time profile subscriptions, offline Dexie/SQLite). Now pick the next phase:

---

# ScriptHammer Roadmap (Struck-Through for Completed)

1. ~~Fake tokens + ephemeral sign-up~~  
2. ~~Add real Supabase auth + RLS~~  
3. ~~DB triggers for automatic profile creation~~  
4. ~~Minimal token storage (SecureStore or localStorage)~~  
5. ~~Real-time subscription for user’s profile~~  
6. ~~Offline/local-first approach (Dexie for web, SQLite for native)~~  

**Next**:

7. **Admin Dashboard** (web)  
8. **CLI Scaffolding** (like Bonfire’s Builder)  
9. **Advanced Roles/Permissions** (admin, moderator)  
10. **Social/Business Features** (posts, file uploads, notifications)  
11. **Production Pipeline** (Expo EAS, env vars, logging, monitoring)

---

## Phase 7: **Admin Dashboard** (Web Interface)

### Potential Objectives
1. **User Management**: view/search/disable accounts, possibly from the same Supabase DB.  
2. **Content Moderation**: delete or edit user posts.  
3. **Analytics**: basic usage stats, sign-ups per day.

### Why It Matters
- A web-based admin panel is easier for staff to manage user data, moderate content, etc.

**System Prompt Code (Phase 7)**

```
You are a senior Expo/React Native developer focusing on Phase 7 of ScriptHammer: “Admin Dashboard (Web Interface).”

I need a fully functional tutorial (no placeholders) showing how to build a web-based admin panel that:
1. Integrates with our Supabase instance for user management and content moderation.
2. Follows best practices (secure routes, etc.).
3. Includes a Node script at the end to automate new files or stubs we create in this tutorial.
```

*(Start a new ChatGPT conversation, paste this as the **System** message, then ask for the tutorial in the **User** message.)*

---

## Phase 8: **CLI Scaffolding Tool** (Like Bonfire’s “Builder”)

### Potential Objectives
1. **Command-Line Interface**: e.g., `npx script-hammer generate module posts`.  
2. **Auto-Generate**: React Native screens, Supabase table creation scripts, context files.  
3. **Configurable**: maybe a YAML/JSON config describing the module fields.

### Why It Matters
- CRUD scaffolding drastically accelerates development.

**System Prompt Code (Phase 8)**

```
You are a senior Expo/React Native developer focusing on Phase 8 of ScriptHammer: “CLI Scaffolding Tool.”

I need a fully functional tutorial (no placeholders) showing how to:
1. Build a Node-based CLI that generates common files (RN screens, Supabase table scripts).
2. Follow best practices so new modules integrate seamlessly into ScriptHammer.
3. End with a Node script that can be copy-pasted to automate scaffolding tasks.
```

---

## Phase 9: **Advanced Roles & Permissions**

### Potential Objectives
1. **Supabase Policies** for role-based access.  
2. **UI** changes: show/hide features unless user is admin or moderator.  
3. Possibly store roles in a separate table or within `profiles`.

### Why It Matters
- Real-world apps need more than “everyone can do everything” or simple RLS.

**System Prompt Code (Phase 9)**

```
You are a senior Expo/React Native developer focusing on Phase 9 of ScriptHammer: “Advanced Roles & Permissions.”

I need a fully functional tutorial (no placeholders) that:
1. Extends our Supabase RLS with roles like admin/moderator.
2. Shows how the front end checks roles to hide or show certain features.
3. Concludes with a scaffolding script to automate role-based UI/policy additions.
```

---

## Phase 10: **Social/Business Features** (Posts, Uploads, Notifications)

### Potential Objectives
1. **Posts & Feeds**: create a “posts” table in Supabase, display in a feed.  
2. **File Uploads**: e.g., images for posts or user avatars. Use Supabase Storage or 3rd-party.  
3. **Notifications**: push notifications (Expo or FCM) or in-app real-time.  
4. **Realtime**: feed updates automatically.

### Why It Matters
- This is how you grow from a simple profile system to a more robust social or business platform.

**System Prompt Code (Phase 10)**

```
You are a senior Expo/React Native developer focusing on Phase 10 of ScriptHammer: “Social/Business Features (Posts, Uploads, Notifications).”

I need a fully functional tutorial (no placeholders) demonstrating:
1. A “posts” feed with Supabase.
2. File uploads (images or docs) via Supabase Storage or a 3rd-party.
3. Optional push notifications for new likes/comments.
4. End with a Node script to automate these new modules/tables.
```

---

## Phase 11: **Production Pipeline** (Expo EAS, Env Vars, Logging, Monitoring)

### Potential Objectives
1. **EAS Build** for iOS/Android.  
2. **Environment Variables** for secrets.  
3. **Logging/Monitoring** with Sentry or Bugsnag.  
4. **Performance**: code splitting, caching.

### Why It Matters
- A stable release pipeline ensures quick updates, bug fixes, environment-specific configs, etc.

**System Prompt Code (Phase 11)**

```
You are a senior Expo/React Native developer focusing on Phase 11 of ScriptHammer: “Production Pipeline (Expo EAS, Env Vars, Logging, Monitoring).”

I need a fully functional tutorial (no placeholders) showing how to:
1. Use Expo EAS to build/submit iOS and Android apps.
2. Manage environment variables securely.
3. Integrate logging or crash reporting (Sentry) in production.
4. Provide a Node script at the end to help automate environment config and logging setup.
```

---

## How to Use These System Prompt Blocks

1. Choose a phase (7–11) you want to tackle.  
2. Start a **fresh** ChatGPT conversation.  
3. Copy the relevant code snippet (including triple backticks) as your **System** message.  
4. In your **User** message, explain what you want in detail, e.g. “Show me a complete admin dashboard tutorial with Next.js and Supabase, including a Node script to automate new admin pages.”  

This ensures ChatGPT is primed to:

- **Reply with a fully functional tutorial** (no placeholders).  
- Provide copy-paste code solutions.  
- End each phase’s reply with a Node script that automates the new iteration’s scaffolding.

---

### Final Note

With phases 1–6 complete (Dexie, SQLite, real-time, RLS, etc.), you’re ready for advanced expansions:

- **Phase 7**: Admin Dashboard  
- **Phase 8**: Scaffolding CLI  
- **Phase 9**: Advanced Roles  
- **Phase 10**: Social/Business expansions  
- **Phase 11**: Production pipeline  

When you’re ready for each step, just use that phase’s **System Prompt Code**. That’s it—happy building with ScriptHammer!
