## Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
**Objective:** Validate core functionality, gather early user feedback, and establish a stable foundation.

### Core User Features
- **User Authentication & Registration:**
  - Basic sign-up and login (email/phone, simple password).
  - Integration with existing authentication modules (e.g., OAuth).
  
- **Profile Management:**
  - Basic profile creation and editing (profile photo, name, bio).
  - Basic privacy settings (public vs. friends-only).

- **Friends and Connections:**
  - Sending and accepting friend requests.
  - Viewing and managing a simple friend list.
  
- **Posts and Content Sharing:**
  - Ability to create, edit, and delete text-based posts.
  - Photo uploads with basic captions.
  - A basic news feed showing posts from friends.

- **Messaging:**
  - Basic in-app text messaging between friends.

- **Notifications:**
  - Real-time push notifications for friend requests, posts, and messages.

- **Basic Privacy and Security Settings:**
  - Controls for content visibility and simple account security (password reset).

### Admin and Backend Features
- **User Moderation & Content Review:**
  - Basic reporting system for flagging inappropriate content.
  - Admin dashboard for reviewing flagged content.

- **Data Analytics:**
  - Tracking key metrics: user registrations, posts, and friend connections.

- **API Endpoints:**
  - Minimal REST/GraphQL endpoints to support mobile features and future integrations.

### Best Practices for MVP
- **UI/UX:** Focus on clean and intuitive interfaces.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement robust error logging to catch issues early.
- **Modularity:** Write modular, well-documented code to enable future feature expansion.
- **Testing:** Establish unit and integration tests to ensure stability.
- **Performance:** Use caching where appropriate to optimize load times.
